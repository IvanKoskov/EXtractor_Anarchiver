This project is now frozen, but if you want to help to revive it please go ahead


 The EXtractor tries to deliever convenient interaction with files, zipping, unzipping, password zipping and range of functionalities without any payment.
 
 • Inspired by [RAR Extractor - Unarchiver Pro](https://apps.apple.com/th/app/rar-extractor-unarchiver-pro/id647505820?mt=12). EXtractor can be considered just a free version of it.
 
 • EXtractor planned to be enhanced version of it.

 • Everyone is very welcomed to contribute to this project

 • The GUI is developed using C++ frameworks and Qmake as it allowed to use C++.

 ## You may encounter such error
 
 > "Example App" Not Opened Apple could not verify "Example App" is free of malware that may harm your Mac or compromise your privacy.

To bypass the "Apple could not verify..." message, go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy**, then click **Open Anyway** next to the app's name. Alternatively, control-click the app in Finder and select **Open** to confirm you want to run it.

Moreover for such errors to not be shown app needs to be code signed so that is why it says it is not trusted.

> [!TIP]
> If you see strange errors just share them to us so they can be fixed.


> [!CAUTION]
> As this app can interact with system files and needs disk access just be sure you are not doing stupid things)

 ## What will be achieved?

 • We are planning to add our own functionality besides the default one in order to make even more attractive to user
